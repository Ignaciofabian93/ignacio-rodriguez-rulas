Some of my skills are highlighted in this marquee animation, covering full-stack development, mobile development, 
and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery. 
I also enjoy cybersecurity in my free time, particularly Hack The Box.
`;
export const paragraph2 = `
Currently, I am learning about AI, mainly with a Meta LLM called Ollama to build a chatbot integrated with LangChain, and I am also exploring Go, 
which is becoming popular in cybersecurity.
`;

export const paragraph3 = `
One of my biggest strengths is my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies. Even in new job environments, 
despite the initial stress, I usually match my team's pace by the second or second-and-a-half month. 
I also build strong communication with my colleagues, and they trust me with critical tasks early on.
`;

export const paragraph4 = `
Recently, at Walmart, I had to learn about Nx to work with monorepos, GraphQL with Apollo, analyze dashboards using Grafana, and continuously improve the code
and test for an expedite deployment process. I am also collaborating with both local and international teams, working with professionals from United States, 
Canada, India and Mexico.
