export const experience = `My journey in IT began during the pandemic when 
I realized I needed a fresh start. I spent many hours in self-learning 
through YouTube tutorials and online courses, quickly mastering the skills 
needed to develop websites for small businesses, coffee shops, and local 
entrepreneurs as a freelancer.
After gaining solid experience, my wife and I moved to Cork, Ireland, where I
improved my English proficiency and expanded my ability to understand English-based
code materials. During this time, I worked with local businesses in Ireland while also
maintaining my projects in Chile, balancing work, studies, and exploring Ireland's
beautiful landscapes.
When we were back in Chile, I joined Agrosat, a startup with a small but dynamic team.
This experience allowed me to take on multiple responsibilities, wear many hats,
and further refine my skills in a fast-paced environment.

export const goals = `My wife and I dream of moving to Canada to build a future 
together. Beyond its culture, landscapes and high quality of life, Canada offers
the medical specialists my wife needs to treat her arthritis, ensuring her long-term
health and well-being.
This goal is my biggest priority, and I am fully committed to making it happen.
Whether it requires mastering a new programming language, frameworks, or
technologies, I am ready to learn whatever it takes to secure a better future for us.`;
